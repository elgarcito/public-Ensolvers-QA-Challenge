# Carina Testing basic configuration
This repository brings you the basic structures and latest
dependencies to use a Carina testing framework.
So far, It doesn't contain the configuration to use:
* myBatis
* TestRail
* Amazon
* Azure
* Crypto
* Dynamic proxy
* Jenkins

For these options, the configuration file has the ones that [Carina Demo](https://github.com/zebrunner/carina-demo) has.

With this structure, dependencies, and plugins, you can test the following kinds of tests:
* Desktop web test
* Mobile with android
* API
### Getting started
To run this project, you will need at least version 21 of Java.
First, clone this repository in a folder of your PC.
You have to put the following command in a terminal:

```bash
  git clone this-repo-url
```
Once copied, you must run the following command in the console:
```bash
  mvn clean install -D skipTests
```

### Web and API Test _config.properties configuration
Steps to create a web test:

1. Fill the [configuration file](src/main/resources/_config.properties) with the following [code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10gQsSpApME1hvKOj14vjLylRovnpL36l/view?usp=drive_link)
2. Fill the `url= ` and `api.url= ` with the `http or https` url of the page or API
that you want to test.


### Android _config.properties configuration
1. Fill the [configuration file](src/main/resources/_config.properties) with the following [code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_uylMFI41w12Iwh9J25lLNXaF6VBvMOs/view?usp=drive_link)
2. You probably should set your following capabilities according to the emulator or device that you are using. You must replace
<> with your info (without using <>).

```
capabilities.automationName=UiAutomator2
capabilities.deviceName=<Your device name>
capabilities.platformVersion=<The emulator or device android version>
capabilities.udid=<The emulator or device android id>
```
3. If you use the global url for this android test, uncomment it in global configuration `#url=` and add your url.

## Start testing
### Previous configuration
### Web testing and API

1. First, start the selenium standalone. You must have previously downloaded the [standalone](https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=3.9/)(last version selenium-server-standalone-3.9.1.jar)
and the [Chromedriver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) (download your Chrome version, you can check it in help using your browser) 
and put them in the same folder.
2. Once done, initiate a cmd window and move to the folder where you save both files. 
3. Run the following command
```
java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=./chromedriver.exe -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.9.1.jar
```
4. This should start the selenium standalone server on port 4444
5. You must leave this cmd console open while you are testing

### Android Testing
1. Install [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Once installed, go inside android studio and settings->Android SDK then click Sdk Tools
3. Select Android SDK Command-line Tools(latest) and android SDK Platform-Tools (if it is not installed). Then apply
4. Configure your environment variable ANDROID_HOME. Create your user variable ANDROID_HOME and path:
```
C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
```
5. Then configure your environment variable go to a path and add at the end:
```
%ANDROID_HOME%\tools
%ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools
C:\Users\edgar\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools
```
6. Click accept
7. Install [node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) latest version

8. Install [appium doctor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@appium/doctor) using, run this on your cmd
```bash
npm install @appium/doctor -g
```
9. Run appium doctor, run this on your cmd 
```bash
appium-doctor
```
Check only for needed configuration not optional
10. Install [appium](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/quickstart/install/), run this on your cmd
```bash
npm i -g appium
```
11. Close the console and install the UiAutomator2 driver, run this on your cmd
```bash
appium driver install uiautomator2
```
12. Install [appium inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector/releases/tag/v2023.12.2)
13. Before start testing only once you must run 
```bash
appium-doctor
```
And leave it open in the background, don't close the console

### Test pages creation recommended steps for android and desktop
0. Before all creations, you should change the configuration file according
   to the type of test that you use on Desktop or Mobile
1. First, create in [common folder](src/main/java/com/solvd/carina/example/gui/pages/common)
the Abstract page class with the abstract methods that your desktop or android web test is going to use.This class
should extend AbstractPage class of carina. You should name it <ClassName>Base for example HomePageBase
2. Then create the implementation of it in the [desktop](src/main/java/com/solvd/carina/example/gui/pages/desktop) folder.
This class should extend its abstract class â€” for example, HomePage extends HomePageBase. 
You must use the following annotation over the child class:
```
@DeviceType(pageType = DeviceType.Type.DESKTOP, parentClass = <ClassName>Base.class)
```
If you are using android
```
@DeviceType(pageType = DeviceType.Type.ANDROID_PHONE, parentClass = <ClassName>Base.class)
```
For example for android:
```
@DeviceType(pageType = DeviceType.Type.ANDROID_PHONE, parentClass = HomePageBase.class)
public class HomePage extends HomePageBase {
```
3. Use protected ExtendedWebElement to save page elements, using the tag over the element created:
```
@FindBy(id,xpath,etc = )
```
For Android, we use xpath, and for desktop any of it. As example
```
    @FindBy(id = "footmenu")
    private FooterMenu footerMenu;
```
4. If we have a method that click on an object, then it creates a new page, we using `initPage(getDriver(),parentBase.class)`
.This mean that we return the Abstract class of the new page **NOT** the implementation. For example, in the HomePage.java
which is an implementation for desktop of the HomePageBase.java abstract class, we override the abstract method
`goToAppPage()`. This method returns us an Abstract AppPageBase Object:
```
    @Override
    public AppPageBase goToAppPage() {
        appButton.click();
        return initPage(getDriver(),AppPageBase.class);
    }
```
5. After you do this you must set an page opening strategy, that mean to set an url or an element in
screen that is needed to check if the page is opened. For example
```
    @FindBy(xpath = "")
    private ExtendedWebElement invalidPageMessage;
    public InvalidPage(WebDriver driver) {
        super(driver);
        setPageOpeningStrategy(PageOpeningStrategy.BY_ELEMENT);
        setUiLoadedMarker(invalidPageMessage);
    }
```
In this example this page that is the result of an action in other class,
that delivers us this InvalidPage. This page has an ExtendedWebElement invalidPageMessage that
is going to be a marker to know if the page has been loaded.First we set an opening strategy
with `setPageOpeningStrategy(PageOpeningStrategy.)` and then set the marker with `setUiLoadedMarker(invalidPageMessage)`

### Test pages creation recommended steps for API testing
0. Before all creations, you should change the configuration file according to API
1. Select an API to test
2. If it is public check using postman or swagger the differents HTTP request
for the POST,GET,DELETE,PUT and PATCH.
3. Save the HTTP and save the needed information for each request
4. Add the base url to the `api_url=` in [config file](src/main/resources/_config.properties) in this example
`api_url=https://api.coincap.io`
5. In the [api](src/main/java/com/solvd/carina/example/api) package create every
method that you are going to use. As example in a criptocurrency API `GetAssetValue.java` this class should
extends `AbstractApiMethodV2`
6. We should add the following annotations to this class:
```
@Endpoint(url = "",methodType =)
@ResponseTemplatePath(path = "")
@RequestTemplatePath(path= "")
@SuccessfulHttpStatus(status = )
```
The first one gives the class information about the url and the method type (GET,POST,etc).
The second gives us information about the path of the response.
The third one gives us information about the path of the request.
The four one gives you information about the correct status of the call.
As example:
```
@Endpoint(url = "${config.api_url}/v2/assets/${assetName}",methodType = HttpMethodType.GET)
@ResponseTemplatePath(path = "api/users/get_asset_rs.json")
@SuccessfulHttpStatus(status = HttpResponseStatusType.OK_200)
public class GetAssetValue extends AbstractApiMethodV2 {
    public GetAssetValue(String assetName){
        ignorePropertiesProcessor(NotStringValuesProcessor.class);
        replaceUrlPlaceholder("assetName",assetName);
    }
}
```
7. We need to create the response JSON, this is going to have the information about
how the response is going to be given and the type in each response and set it in
the [api](src/test/resources/api) package.
8. Then we create an JSON schema to compare it later using this [page](https://www.liquid-technologies.com/online-json-to-schema-converter)
and leave it in the same page this document must be `document.schema`
9.  Finally we create in the [domain](src/main/java/com/solvd/carina/example/domain) package the persistance class this class is a 
POJO (Plain old java object). This class only contains the information needed to be checked later or used in the test, having only
field, getters and setters.


### Test creation 
1. All web Test classes should implement IAbstractTest as example
```
public class HelloWorld implements IAbstractTest {}
```
For Android apps also, we should implement and IAndroidUtils (For IOS and android IMobileUtils), as an example for android:
```
public class HelloWorld implements IAbstractTest,IAndroidUtils {}
```
General example
```
public class HelloWorld implements IAbstractTest,IMobileUtils {}
```
2. When creating test the main idea is to have an action and then an assertion
to check if every step is done properly
3. When we test WEB we must use `.open()` and also then we check it when
`.isPageOpened()`
4. When we test API we should test `.expectResponseStatus(HttpResponseStatusType.OK_200)` with 
this we check the proper response status then, `.callAPI()` to call the API. 
Finally we use `.validateResponseAgainstSchema("path")`
5. When calling a suite in `POM.xml` we should change `<suite>suit_xml_name</suite>`
6. If we want to add TEST data we use the following `R.TESTDATA.get("propertyName")`.
We must previously have created the `_testdata.properties` in the resources folder, this file
should be written in the following way, as example:
```
user:standard_user
password:secret_sauce
```
So if we want to use it in the test, we should write, as example:
``` 
loginPage.typeUsername(R.TESTDATA.get("user"));
loginPage.typePassword(R.TESTDATA.get("password"));
```
